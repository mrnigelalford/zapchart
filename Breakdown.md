### Technical Architecture

#### 1. Frontend: Next.js

- **Purpose:** Serve as the user interface for managing API keys, viewing usage statistics, and customizing chart templates.
- **Deployment:** Host the Next.js application on Vercel or AWS Amplify for seamless integration with AWS services.

#### 2. Backend: AWS Lambda with Puppeteer and Chart.js

- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /generate-chart`: Triggered by an AWS API Gateway, this Lambda function accepts data and customization parameters, generates a chart using Chart.js, and captures it as an image using Puppeteer.
  - `GET /chart/:id`: Retrieves the chart image by ID from S3.

- **Chart Generation:**
  - Use Chart.js within the Lambda function to create charts.
  - Use Puppeteer to render the chart in a headless browser and capture it as an image.

- **Storage:**
  - Store generated images in an S3 bucket.
  - Use S3 event notifications to trigger additional processing if needed.

#### 3. Content Delivery: AWS CloudFront

- **Purpose:** Distribute chart images globally with low latency.
- **Setup:** Configure CloudFront to cache and serve images stored in S3.

#### 4. Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation

- **Purpose:** Automate the deployment and management of AWS resources.
- **Components:**
  - Define resources such as Lambda functions, API Gateway, S3 buckets, and CloudFront distributions in a CloudFormation template.
  - Use parameters and outputs to manage configuration and deployment.

### Pricing Recommendations

To create a sustainable business model, consider the following pricing structure:

#### 1. Free Tier

- **Features:**
  - Limited number of API calls per month (e.g., 100 calls).
  - Basic chart types and customization options.
- **Purpose:** Attract new users and allow them to test the service.

#### 2. Basic Plan ($10/month)

- **Features:**
  - Increased API call limit (e.g., 1,000 calls).
  - Access to additional chart types and customization options.
  - Email support.

#### 3. Pro Plan ($50/month)

- **Features:**
  - Higher API call limit (e.g., 10,000 calls).
  - Priority email support.
  - Access to advanced chart features and templates.
  - Custom branding options for charts.

#### 4. Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing)

- **Features:**
  - Unlimited API calls.
  - Dedicated account manager.
  - SLA with guaranteed uptime.
  - Custom integrations and features.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Next.js Project:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project.
   - Set up pages for the dashboard, chart customization, and API documentation.

2. **Develop Lambda Functions:**
   - Create a Lambda function for chart generation using Node.js.
   - Integrate Chart.js and Puppeteer within the Lambda function.

3. **Configure AWS Services:**
   - **S3:** Create a bucket for storing chart images.
   - **CloudFront:** Set up a distribution to serve images from S3.
   - **API Gateway:** Create an API to trigger Lambda functions.
   - **CloudFormation:** Write a template to automate the deployment of these resources.

4. **Deploy and Monitor:**
   - Deploy the application using CloudFormation.
   - Set up CloudWatch for monitoring Lambda performance and API usage.
